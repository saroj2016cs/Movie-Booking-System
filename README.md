# Movie-Booking-System

This application allows users to book movie tickets. The main() function is present inside MovieBookingSystem.cpp.

I have built a movie ticket booking system with the following features:

1. Add movies and their respective theater names to the movie list.
2. The BackEnd() method provides a framework for entering details of each movie.
3. The FrontEnd() method offers an interactive command-line interface for choosing movies.
4. After selecting a movie, choose the theater where you would like to book tickets.
5. View available seats and booked seats in the chosen theater.
6. Select the tickets to be booked. For single seat booking, enter one seat number without quotes (e.g., "A1"). For multiple seats, use a comma-separated list (e.g., "A1,A17,A20") or a range (e.g., "A3-A13").
7. A success or failure message will be displayed on the screen.
8. Unit testing test cases are also provided. To run the test cases, uncomment the two lines in MovieBookingSystem.cpp.

Please note that several improvements are possible. Given the time constraint, I have done my best to provide a solution.
