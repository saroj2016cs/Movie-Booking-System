1. I have build the Movie Ticket booking system.
2. The Movies and their respective theatre name needs to inserted to the Movie List.
3. The BackEnd() method provides a framework to enter details of each Movie.
4. The FrontEnd() gives an interactive Command line interface for choosing the movies.
5. After choosing the movie, choose the theatre where you would like to book a tickets.
6. After choosing the theatre, see the avilable seats and booked seats.

       For single seat booking enter one seat number (without quotes): "A1"  
       Multiple: "A1,A17,A20"
       Range based: "A3-A13"
8. Note Success or failure message displayed on the screen.
9. Unit testing test cases are also provided. Please uncomment the two lines in MovieBookingSystem.cpp for running the test cases.
